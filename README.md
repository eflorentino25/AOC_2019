Catch a fruit game.

This game was developed in assembly.

The game logic is simple, the code prints every pixel one by one with reference to a point in the screen, once theres a colision between the fruit moving downwards with the basket
it computes the value to the user.

we changed the order of the printing on the screen so that the fruits get printed last, to give the illusion they are in front of the lady(game character) in question.
